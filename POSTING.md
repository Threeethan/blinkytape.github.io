Things to know:

Blog posts:
	Author name is transformed to become the link to your bio page. "author: Matt Mets" => "/bio/mattmets". Don't change your name.

Project posts:
	Permalink should be /$PROJECT_NAME/index.html. E.G. => "permalink: /daftpunk/index.html". Otherwise URLs will not be pretty.
	The img tag is the folder in which your images for this page are stored. Make a lowercase folder for the project page and put the name in the img tag.
