## Prepare Arduino to Program Your BlinkyTape

We're going to configure the Arduino environment to put software onto your Blinkytape. This should be pretty easy.

1. Choose **Tools | Board | Arduino Leonardo**
2. Select your BlinkyBoard's serial port in the **Tools | Serial Port ** menu. The port will be named something like 'COM2' on Windows, and something like /dev/tty.usbmodemab123 or /dev/cu.usbmodemab123 -- you can choose either one.
