## Install the BlinkyTape Processing Libraries

Now that you have downloaded Processing, it's time to download some helper code and examples. This stuff lets us make our programs a bit more simply than if we had to do everything from scratch, as you'll see later on.

### Get it. 
Here is the link to [what we want](https://github.com/Blinkinlabs/BlinkyTape_Processing). This is a live GitHub repository, so it should always be up to date. Use the *"Download ZIP"* link on the right of the page.<!--- we'll have to change this when there's a different download link --->

### Install it
Unzip this folder in your Processing libraries folder - this is located at `Documents/Processing/libraries` on Mac or `My Documents\Processing\libraries` on Windows. 

**Important:** When you unzip the file, the resulting folder will probably be called something like `BlinkyTape_Processing-master` -- delete everything after the underscore, or Processing won't import the library. (It doesn't like special characters.)

## Install the ControlP5 library
The last step before firing up PatternPaint is to install a Processing library
called "ControlP5." This helps us draw interface elements. 

Luckily, Processing 2 has a way to easily install ControlP5 without
downloading it separately. In Processing, open the **Sketch** menu, followed by
**Import Library**, then **Add Library**.  A new **Library Manager** window will
appear. In the "*Filter your search...*" box, type in 'controlp5' and click the
ControlP5 item that appears to install it.

If you have any trouble, [here's some more info about libraries for
Processing](http://processing.org/reference/libraries/) including [instructions
for manually installing libraries](http://wiki.processing.org/w/How_to_Install_a_Contributed_Library).
If you need to install it manually, you can download ControlP5 from [the
ControlP5 home page](http://www.sojamo.de/libraries/controlP5/).

## Restart Processing, if it is running.

You should now see the BlinkyTape examples if you go to **File | Examples**. This will open a chooser-type window so you can scroll through all of your installed examples for Processing.  You'll find ours in **Contributed Libraries | BlinkyTape**.
