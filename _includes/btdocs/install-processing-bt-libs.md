## Install the BlinkyTape Processing Libraries

Now that you have downloaded Processing, it's time to download some helper code and examples. This stuff lets us make our programs a bit more simply than if we had to do everything from scratch, as you'll see later on.

### Get it. 
Here is the link to [what we want](/blinkytape/BlinkyTape.zip). <!--- we'll have to change this when there's a different download link --->

### Install it
Unzip this folder in your Processing libraries folder - this is located at Documents/Processing/libraries on Mac or My Documents\Processing\libraries on Windows.

## Restart Processing, if it is running.

You should now see the BlinkyTape examples if you go to **File | Examples**. This will open a chooser-type window so you can scroll through all of your installed examples for Processing.  You'll find ours in **Contributed Libraries | BlinkyTape**.
