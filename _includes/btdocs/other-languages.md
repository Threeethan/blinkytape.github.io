## But I don't want to use Processing!
Oh man, sorry we went on about Processing for so long! We get it, you're into Lisp or Haskell or Fortran or whatever. That's great. We're really happy about that, but we're going to need you to help us spread support for BlinkyTape to other platforms. This Processing-based tutorial should give you a good idea about how to get started.

As it happens, there have been some efforts already. You can find some work for python [here in a BlinkinLabs Github repository](https://github.com/Blinkinlabs/BlinkyTape_Python) and we understand that there is a Perl module to be found in good old CPAN.  Check out [this usage example](https://github.com/Blinkinlabs/BlinkyTape_Perl).
