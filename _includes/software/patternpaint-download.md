# Downloading PatternPaint

## Prerequisites

To use PatternPaint, you'll need to download and install:

* [Processing](http://processing.org/download/) - Use the latest stable.  PatternPaint is known to work with Processing 2.0.2.
* [Arduino](http://arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) - Allows patterns to be saved to the BlinkyTape, so not needed if you're only going to use your BlinkyTape while it's connected to a computer.

## Install the BlinkyTape Processing Libraries

Now that you have downloaded Processing, let's get the BlinkyTape examples. This stuff lets us make our programs a bit more simply than if we had to do everything from scratch, as you'll see later on. There's also some helper code in here if you start programming for yourself a little down the line.

### Get it. 
Here is the link to [what we want](/blinkytape/BlinkyTape.zip). <!--- we'll have to change this when there's a different download link --->

### Install it
Unzip this folder in your Processing libraries folder - this is located at Documents/Processing/libraries on Mac or My Documents\Processing\libraries on Windows.

## Restart Processing, if it is running.

You should now see the BlinkyTape examples if you go to **File | Examples**. This will open a chooser-type window so you can scroll through all of your installed examples for Processing.  You'll find ours in **Contributed Libraries | BlinkyTape**. 

## Install the ControlP5 library
The last step before firing up PatternPaint is to install a Processing library called "ControlP5." This helps us draw interface elements. Luckily, Processing 2 lets us easily install it by going to **Sketch | Import Library | Add Library**. A new window with a search box should pop up when you select this option - just type in 'controlp5' and click to install. If you have any trouble, [here's some more info about libraries for Processing](http://processing.org/reference/libraries/) including [manual install instructions](http://wiki.processing.org/w/How_to_Install_a_Contributed_Library).
